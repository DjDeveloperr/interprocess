//! Support for named pipes on Windows.
//!
//! ## Windows named pipes are not Unix named pipes
//! The term "named pipe" refers to completely different things in Unix and Windows. For this reason, Unix named pipes are referred to as "FIFO files" to avoid confusion with the more powerful Windows named pipes. In fact, the only common features for those two is that they both can be located using filesystem paths and they both use a stream interface. The simplest way to explain their differences is using a list:
//! - Windows named pipes are located on a separate filesystem (NPFS — **N**amed **P**ipe **F**ile**s**ystem), while Unix FIFO files live in the shared filesystem tree together with all other files
//!     - On Linux, the implementation of Unix domain sockets exposes a similar feature: by setting the first byte in the socket file path to `NULL` (`\0`), the socket is placed into a separate namespace instead of being placed on the filesystem; this is non-standard extension to POSIX and is not available on other Unix systems
//! - Windows named pipes have a server and an arbitrary number of clients, meaning that the separate processes connecting to a named pipe have separate connections to the server, while Unix FIFO files don't have the notion of a server or client and thus mix all data written into one sink from which the data is read by one process
//! - Windows named pipes can be used over the network, while a Unix FIFO file is still local even if created in a directory which is a mounted network filesystem
//! - Windows named pipes can maintain datagram boundaries, allowing both sides of the connection to operate on separate messages rather than on a byte stream, while FIFO files, like any other type of file, expose only a byte stream interface
//!
//! If you carefully read through this list, you'd notice how Windows named pipes are similar to Unix domain sockets. For this reason, the implementation of "local sockets" in the `local_socket` module of this crate uses named pipes on Windows and Ud-sockets on Unix.

/// Defines the properties of pipe stream types.
///
/// ## Why there are multiple types of pipe streams
/// One of the similarities between Unix domain sockets and Windows named pipes is how both can be used in datagram mode and in byte stream mode, that is, like with sockets, Windows named pipes can both maintain the boundaries between packets or erase those boundaries — the specific behavior can be controlled both during pipe creation and during connection. The reader can still use the stream interface even if the writer maintains datagram boundaries, and vice versa: the system automatically disassembles the datagrams into a byte stream with virtually no cost.
///
/// The distinction between datagram-oriented connections and byte streams exists for symmetry with the standard library, where UDP and TCP sockets are represented by different types. The idea behind this is that by separating the two semantic types of sockets into two types, the distinction between those semantics can be enforced at compile time instead of using runtime errors to signal that, for example, a datagram read operation is attempted on a byte stream.
///
/// The fact that named pipes can have different data flow directions further increases the amount of various stream types. By restricting the implemented stream traits at compile time, named pipe streams can be used correctly in generic contexts unaware of named pipes without extra runtime checking for the correct pipe direction.
